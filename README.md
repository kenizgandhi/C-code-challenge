# C-code-challenge
Day 1 of coding challenge in C++

/*Given a square matrix of size n x n. 
*Find minimum number of operation required to make sum of elements on each row and column become equal. 
*In one operation, increament any value of cell of matrix only by 1. 
*Take an input from user for value n and matrix values. 
*Print minimum number of operations required. 
*Print ‘n’ integers representing the final matrix after operation.
